# Question 4 - Replace the double space from problem 3 with single spaces.

name = "Naman is a good  boy"

print(name.replace("  ", " "))
print(name)  # name string has not change, it has been printed as a new string. strings are immutable which means that you cannot change them by running fuctions on them.
